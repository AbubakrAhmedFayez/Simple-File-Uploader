# Simple-File-Uploader
A simple example of how to implement file uploading with a progress bar and timer using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.


This project is a file uploader web application that enables users to upload files to a server. The front-end of the application is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the HTML providing the structure, the CSS styling the interface, and the JavaScript handling the file upload and progress updates. The server-side functionality is implemented using PHP.

The application features a form with a file input field and a submit button. Upon selecting a file and clicking the submit button, the file is uploaded to the server via an AJAX request. The application also displays a progress bar and timer to provide the user with feedback on the progress and estimated time remaining during the file upload process.

There are several areas for improvement in this application. For example, the application could be enhanced to support the simultaneous upload of multiple files, display a list of previously uploaded files, and allow the user to delete previously uploaded files.
